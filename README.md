# Loan-Default-Prediction
Like most lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss. By this project  the I wants to understand the driving factors behind loan default. I employed classification models such as DecisionTree,RandomForest,Xg-Boost focusing on target variable “Loan-Status”. The dataset contain wide range of features that offers insights to the problem.
Employing key libraries including Pandas, Numpy ,Matplotlib ,Seaborn and Sklearn I conducted data preprocessing, feature selection and engineering. These steps were pivotal in ensuring data quality and enhanceing predicting power of the models.
